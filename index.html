              <p>Hi! I am a senior majoring in English and minoring in TAM while also getting my teacher licensure
                for secondary education. I have lots of experience from my continuing two-year internship making
                websites on open source applications like Wordpress and only using CSS/HTML to tweak specific things
                per client in the website code, so I am really excited to be working more primarily with code this
                semester! When I'm not in class or student teaching, I like to read, play soccer, and watch football
                (for Colorado teams, always, since I am a native!). Here is the my <a href="https://aboutme.alexisharris.buffscreate.net/#">website portfolio</a>,
                made with Wordpress with an already generated theme.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="goals">
          <h1 id="goalshead"><span>Goals for the Course</span></h1>
            <ul>
              <li>To be able to make my own website without only using open source platforms like Wordpress (Maybe from scratch? Not sure how far we'll get in this class!).</li>
              <li>To use code to then remake my Wordpress portfolio and make it my own.</li>
              <li>I do have experience with HTML and some CSS, so I am looking forward to learning more advanced CSS! </li>
              <li> Get more comfortable coding without having to often reference the internet. </li>
              <li> To possibly learn more about backend development, and how a website actually works with JavaScript and other programs </li>
            </ul>

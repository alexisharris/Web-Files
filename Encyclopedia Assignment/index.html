      <h1 style="font-size:40px">Animals on the Harris Farm</h1>
        <p style="font-size:20px">When I am not in Boulder for the school year, I go back home for the summer and live on what I like to call, a wannabe farm.
          My home is in Black Forest Colorado, on a small stretch of 5 acre land. We recently moved there about two years ago,
          and as soon as we moved, my parents suddenly started acquiring farm animals. For no apparent reason
          other than they thought it would be cool. It started with chickens, and then
          we added a horse, then some ducks, then some goats, and now we've just gotten pigs. If we get any more, I am sure I will update my distinction from
          wannabe farm to full fledged farm. Meet the farm animals below!</p>

        <h1>The Chickens</h1>
          <p>The chickens are the oldest part of the farm, and we actually had about 5 chickens in our little suburb before
          we moved to Black Forest, and we've been using them for eggs. However, when we moved to Black Forest, the chickens seemingly multiplied. We now have
          something like 20 chickens on the farm. Since we have so many, I will not introduce all of them, but please enjoy
          the pictures of just <em>some</em> of them below.</p>

      <section id="horse" style="margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom: 100px;">
        <h1>Poncho the Horse </h1>
          <p>We have had Poncho for a while, but he just moved onto the farm when we built it. Poncho is my little sister's Horse
          and he is very needy. Since horses are herd animals, he originally also had a friend being boarded at our house to keep
          him company. Unfortunately, his friend had to move, and he was freaking out, so we eventually had to get our goats which
          will be introduced below. Poncho loves carrots and complaining when he's hungry.</p>
          <table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">

              <td><img src="assets/poncho1.JPG" style= "width: 13vw" alt="Horse in stable"></td>

      <section id="ducks" style="margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom: 100px;">
        <h1>The Ducks</h1>
          <p>I'm not really sure what the story behind the ducks are, one day I came home and they were just there and my dad
            and sister were laughing maniacally and my mom was stewing inside. Nonetheless, we have many ducks and they are
            extremely loud. We do get duck eggs, which taste exactly like chicken eggs, but a little chewier, which is a little
            offputting for some people. Here are some pictures of them when they were little, and one that shows their cuddly side.

      <section id="goats" style="margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom: 100px;">
        <h1>The Goats</h1>
          <p>The goats were an addition to the farm that were supposed to solve a problem, but actually created one. We got the
            goats because, after the friend horse left Poncho, we needed some companion animals for him. However, instead of
            making Poncho feel more comfortable, the goats got attachment issues and now they freak out whenever he leaves
            to go on a walk. Introducing Bonnie and Luna, our two goats with attachment issues.

      <section id="pigs" style="margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom: 100px;">
        <h1>The Pigs</h1>
          <p> The pigs were are the most recent addition to the farm. They used to be afraid of everything because they came
            from people who didn't take great care of them, but now they love my little sister. They are teacup pigs, and won't
            get much bigger than they are now as babies. They are named Harley and Penny.
